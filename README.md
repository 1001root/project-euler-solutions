# Project Euler Solutions

These are my solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) Problems. 
Doing these for two reasons: 
* For fun when I'm bored. 
* To get to know Python. `#Newbie`.

> "Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and 
> enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics."
